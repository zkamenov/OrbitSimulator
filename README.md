# World Orbit Fortune 4

This is a 3D orbit simulator written in pure Java without any external libraries.
It mathematically solves for Keppler's equation and laws, as well as 3D trigonometry.

It displays the orbital parameters of the simulation, including mass, semi-major axis, apoapsis, periapsis,
eccentricity, and orbital speed.

Textures are based on publicly available maps of celestial bodies, including ones from NASA. Textures are applied to
objects through spherical polar coordinates, and rotational transformation.

## How to Use

### Controls

When the program is opened, a launcher will pop up. Click `Launch` to start the program.

`Q & E` - Zoom in/out, respectively

`O & P` - Slow down/ speed up time, respectively

`N & M` - Switch object back/forth, respectively

`G` - Toggle orbit display

`L` - Toggle low quality mode (use this if the simulator is really slow for your computer

`K` - Toggle stats on the side + perihelion & aphelion
